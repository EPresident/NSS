		<h1>Neo Savegame Scavenger v1.003 - 21/02/2015</h1>
		<p>This utility program will help you managing your NEOScavenger savegames. It allows you to keep multiple backups of your savegames, and restore any of them at will.</p>
		<h4>Features</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Instant backup, each backup is named by the current date and hour</li>
		<li>Quick restore: restores the most recent backup available</li>
		<li>Normal restore: choose a backup to restore from those available</li>
		<li>Clear the savegame of NEOScavenger (deleting all the files inside the save folder)</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Launching the program for the first time</h4>
		<p>The first time you launch the program you will be asked to provide the paths to your savegame and backup folders. To do so, open the Options menu
		( the "Cog" button ), insert the paths, then click "Confirm &amp exit". A config file will be generated to store your preferences. Please note that only
		valid paths to existing folders will be accepted by the program.
		<u>Edit the config file at your own risk.</u></p></br>
