		<h4>Features</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Instant backup, each backup is named by the current date</li>

		<h4>Launching the program for the first time</h4>
		<p>The first time you launch the program you will be asked to provide the paths to your savegame and backup folders. To do so, open the Options menu
		( the "Cog" button ), insert the paths, then click "Confirm &amp exit". A config file will be generated to store your preferences.
